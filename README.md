# Lower-Novartica

Lower Nuovartica was far from what it once was—a thriving, prosperous city that now lay in ruins, shadows of its former glory. It was known as the Ghost Town, and it was a place where the remnants of humanity found solace in the darkness. The crumbling buildings were covered in moss, thriving only in the damp and gloom, and home to creatures that had always lurked in the shadows.

As you walked through the city, it wasn't hard to see the past splendor peeking through the cracks—once-towering skyscrapers now reduced to rubble and once-smooth roads now filled with potholes and mud. It starkly contrasted the gleaming, heavenly structures in Upper Nuovartica, a reminder of what humanity had lost.

In this forsaken place, refugees tried to carve out a life for themselves among the rats, ants, and insects. Among them was a teenage boy, a skilled hacker who had built a hidden shelter known only to himself. Fascinated by machinery and technology, he scoured the debris for discarded parts, crafting a bionic eye, complete with electronic neurons, to replace his damaged right eye. This eye also functioned as a portable computer, always at his side.

The boy had spent his entire life in the Ghost Town without parents or even a name. By chance, he had discovered the secret hideout, previously occupied by another hacker who had mysteriously vanished. Taking possession of the space, he quickly absorbed the knowledge left behind in the computer and notes, becoming an adept and skilled hacker in a few short years.

He felt no connection to the world around him; instead, he found solace in the virtual realm. Paid commissions and pursuing shady information filled his days as he tapped away on his computer in the darkness.

The Ghost Town, a relic of human life from the 2030s and 2040s, was a dangerous place. Its subway stations, classrooms, abandoned malls, and theaters were now overrun by plants and strange animals. Adventurers dared to enter, seeking excitement or resources, but the area had become a perilous maze—new, unknown creatures had evolved, more terrifying than anything known before 2045.

The Dark Market, a secret underworld lying beneath the ruins of Lower Nuovartica, was shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Whispers of powerful individuals backing the market circulated as it traded in rare items, animals, and materials salvaged from the wreckage. At its heart was an information shop that traded knowledge for bartered goods or completed tasks rather than money.

In the Dark Market, trust was a rare commodity. Everything had a price, even the customers. It was a place where the impossible became reality, and the line between fantasy and truth blurred.

The story of Lower Nuovartica, the Ghost Town, was one of survival and adaptation, of secrets and darkness. Beneath it all, an intricate network of tunnels wove through the underbelly of the city, hiding even more mysteries yet to be discovered.
